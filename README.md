<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, My name is Alim Naufal</h1>

🚀 I’m a Frontend Engineer with 3+ years of professional remote experience in Japan and Indonesia, specializing in React and TypeScript.

I regularly work in Node.js environments and have hands-on experience building and maintaining component libraries using Storybook, including contributions to open-source projects. I’ve also worked on CMS-based websites using frameworks like Next.js and TinaCMS.

Currently, I design and maintain frontend systems for an ML/NLP-driven HR platform, enabling seamless integration and visualization of AI-powered features, while focusing on scalable React architecture and component quality.
